Rental property roi
  - factors:
        - property type (airbnb vs residential)
        - best to calculate throughout the year
        - operating expenses
              -mortgage payment 
              - property tax
              - maintenance/improvements/local regulations
  - 3 methods to calculate roi - depends on finance method and initial amount borrowed (aim for 10% plus ROI)
      - simple ROI = (Annual Rental Income - Annual Operating Costs) / Mortage Value
      - Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate) = Net Operating Income / Purchase Price × 100%
          - used when paid in cash
      - Cash-on-Cash return = (Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100%
          - used when mortgaged
  - Key Statistics
      - Gross Rent = total monthly rent
      - Operating Expenses = 30-55% of gross rent (allegedly)
          - repairs, maintenance, insurance
          - 50% Rule —> A rental property's sum of operating expenses hovers around 50% of income. 
          - Operating expenses do not include mortgage principal or interest. The other 50% can be used to pay the monthly mortgage payment. 
          - This can be used to quickly estimate the cash flow and profit of an investment.
      - Debt Coverage Ratio = Net Operating Income / Monthly Debt 
          - ability to pay monthly mortgage/debt (after expenses)
          - value over 1 suggests sufficient ability to pay
      - Gross Rent Multiplyer = total sales price / annual gross rent
          - value of investment relative to gross rent
          - good to compare to other properties to find relative expense
      - Monthly Income = gross rents - (mortgage payment + monthly expenses)
          - before-tax cash flow expected monthly
      -  Equity Dividend Ratio = after-tax cash flow / total equity
          - return of equity you would expect from the property
      -  Estimated Cash at Closing = down payment + closing costs + legal costs + enhancements
      -  Break Even Ratio = operating expenses + debt payments / total gross rent
          - measures vulnerability of property is to gross rent swings and an assessment of financial leeway you have in lowered rents before the property's rent no longer covers all the expenses
          - lower the %, the more leeway you have
      -  Cap Rate (Duplicate - Capitalization Rate) = Net Operating Income / sales price
          - potential rate of return from rental property
          - Cap rate is the effective ROI for the property if you paid 100% cash for the purchase
      - Internal Rate of return RESEARCH***
          - annualized total return
          - annual rate earned on each dollar invested for the period it is invested
          - higher the better
          - Need Net Present Value (NPV)
      - Net Present Value = (Cash flow/(1 + return or discount rate)^# of time periods) - initial investment
      - Debt Service = monthly mortgage payment
- Important Data
      - Sales/Asking Price
      - Down payment

      - Upfront enhancements
      - Average Monthly Rent per unit

      - Expense Ratio - % of gross rent expected to be needed for operating expenses
